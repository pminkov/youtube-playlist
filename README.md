#### A YouTube playlist with start and end times

YouTube doesn't support creating a playlist with start and end times of each individual video, but you can write your own using the [IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference).

To watch: [https://rawgit.com/pminkov/youtube-playlist/master/play.html](https://rawgit.com/pminkov/youtube-playlist/master/play.html). Funny moments from a Bulgarian TV show.

This doesn't work that great on mobile devices, since they don't allow automatic playing of videos and you'll need to press the play button manually.
